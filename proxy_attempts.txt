PROXY IMPLEMENTATION ATTEMPTS

1. Bright Data
- Tried using Bright Data's proxy service
- Used format: http://username:password@brd.superproxy.io:22225
- Issues: Authentication failed, connection timeouts
- Status: Failed to implement

2. Scrape.do
- Attempted both API and proxy methods
- Used format: http://api.scrape.do?token={api_key}&url={url}
- Also tried: http://{api_key}@proxy.scrape.do:8080
- Issues: Connection resets, slow response times
- Status: Failed to implement

3. Geonode Free Proxy List
- Used their API endpoint
- URL: https://proxylist.geonode.com/api/proxy-list
- Filtered for:
  * High uptime (>90%)
  * Elite anonymity
  * HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Issues: Proxies were unreliable, most failed to connect
- Status: Failed to implement

4. ProxyScrape
- Tried their v4 API
- URL: https://api.proxyscrape.com/v4/free-proxy-list
- Attempted filtering for:
  * Fast response times (<500ms)
  * High uptime (>95%)
  * Specific countries (US, CA, GB, DE, FR)
- Issues: Connection timeouts, proxy authentication failures
- Status: Failed to implement

5. Public Proxy Lists (GitHub)
- Tried multiple sources:
  * TheSpeedX/PROXY-List
  * ShiftyTR/Proxy-List
  * monosans/proxy-list
- Issues: Most proxies were dead or too slow
- Status: Failed to implement

Common Issues Across All Attempts:
1. Connection timeouts
2. Authentication failures
3. Slow response times
4. Twitter/X blocking proxy connections
5. "Unusual login activity" detection
6. Inconsistent proxy availability
7. High latency affecting automation

Next Steps:
1. Will try Oxylabs residential proxies with 7-day trial
2. Planning to implement automatic proxy rotation every 10 requests
3. Building proxy validator with latency and uptime checks
4. Adding exponential backoff retry logic (3 attempts with increasing delays)
